  Routine to compute matrix vector product y = Ax where:
  Precondition: First call exchange_externals to get off-processor values of x

  This is the reference SPMV implementation.  It CANNOT be modified for the
  purposes of this benchmark.

  @param[in]  A the known system matrix
  @param[in]  x the known vector
  @param[out] y the On exit contains the result: Ax.

  @return returns 0 upon success and non-zero otherwise
